                <h1>Model</h1>
                <p>
                    $\qquad$The base model architecture consists of two parallel LSTM-RNN based networks, denoted as
                    $Pitch$ Network and $Duration$ Network, which model the pitch sequence $P$ and the duration 
                    sequence $D$, respectively. The models are trained to maximize the conditional log-likelihood for 
                    the current pitch and duration, given information about the previous notes. For the $Pitch$ network, this translates to 
                    $$\max_{\theta_P}\sum_{t}logprob(P_t | I_{ \lt t}), t\in[0, L-1]\qquad(1)$$ 
                    where $P_t$ is the pitch of the $t^{th}$ note, $I_{\lt t}$ is information about all notes that have
                    occurred before the $t^{th}$ note, $L$ is number of notes in the melody, $\theta_P$ is the
                    parameterization of the $Pitch$ network. Similarly, for the $Duration$ network, the equation is:
                    $$\max_{\theta_D}\sum_{t}logprob(D_t | I_{\lt t}), t\in[0, L-1]\qquad(2)$$
                    where $D_t$ is the duration of the $t^{th}$ note, $\theta_D$ is the parametrization of the $Duration$ network. 
                    All other symbols retain the same meaning as in Equation 1.
                    <br> 
                    $\qquad$The term $I_t$, which denotes information for the $t^{th}$ note, is constructed by
                    concatenating embeddings computed for each input in a given conditioning configuration. A list of 
                    the conditioning configurations used is provided in Table 1.

                <p class="caption">$\small{\textbf{Table 1:}}$ List of all conditioning configurations. Each conditioning 
                is implemented by concatenating one more additional embeddings to the input of the networks.
                <p>
                <p>
                    $\qquad$The pitch embeddings $p_t$, duration embeddings $d_t$ and the bar-position embeddings $b_t$ are computed
                    by processing the elements in $P$, $D$ and $B$, respectively, through their respective embedding layers.
                    For chord embeddings $c_t$ and next chord embeddings $n_t$, the root token of the chords are passed
                    through an embedding layer, while the pitch class vectors are encoded using a set of fully connected
                    layers. The outputs of these layers are then concatenated, and subsequently processed together by a
                    second set of fully connected layers to obtain the final chord embeddings.
                    <br><br>
                    $\qquad$In each conditioning configuration, embeddings for the used conditioning inputs are concatenated
                    with the pitch and duration embeddings to form the information vector $I_t$. For example, in the
                    $\texttt{No-Cond}$ configuration of the $\textit{Pitch}$ network, $I_t$ will only contain the pitch
                    embedding, whereas in the $\texttt{CI}$ configuration, $I_t$ will be the concatenation of the pitch
                    embedding, the current chord embedding, and the duration embedding. 
                    <br><br>
                    $I_t$ is then encoded by a set of fully connected layers before being passed through the LSTM-RNN. The output of the
                    LSTM-RNN is decoded by a second set of fully connected layers and activations, followed by a Log-Softmax layer. An
                    overview of the model architecture $\texttt{CNIB}$ configuration) is shown in Figure 1. All other
                    configurations are a subset of this architecture, i.e, they can be derived by selectively removing a subset of the
                    connections prior to the concatenation operation.
